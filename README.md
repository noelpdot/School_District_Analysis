# School_District_Analysis
Using Pandas library in python and Jupyter Notebook or Lab, to analyze school's performances. 

## Project Overview
To Analyze A school district's standards in regards to students grades with respect to scores in math, reading and overall school's performance.

The district school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that there is evidence of dishonesty with grades related to math and reading for Thomas High School 9th graders that apprered to be altered. Since, the school board does not know the extent of this dishonesty, they wanted Maria and her supervisor to uphold the state-testing standards and report the difference.

## Resources

- Data Source 1: schools_complete.csv
